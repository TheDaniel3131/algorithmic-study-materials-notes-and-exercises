# Lesson 2

# Pseudocode

- It is a description of a computer programming algorithm
- It uses structural conventions of programming languages and natural language.
- Omits detailed instructions or language-specific syntax.
- It is a high-level language and aims to generalize the logic and flow of a program.
- Pseudocode cannot be compiled and it is an abstraction of programming language.

Data abstraction hides unwanted details from user to avoid being complex. It is like encapsulation.
