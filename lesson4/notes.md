# Lesson 2

# Pseudocode

- It is a description of a computer programming algorithm
- It uses structural conventions of programming languages and natural language.
- Omits detailed instructions or language-specific syntax.
- It is a high-level language and aims to generalize the logic and flow of a program.
- Pseudocode cannot be compiled and it is an abstraction of programming language.

Data abstraction hides unwanted details from user to avoid being complex. It is like encapsulation.

## Algorithm Vs Pseudocode

Algorithm is a systemaic, logicsl approach whereas pseudocode is a simplfiied version of programming code or pseudocode.

### Bubble Sort (Pseudocode)

Bubble sort algorithm is like throwing a rock in the pond, because water is more compact than air to create a space.

In this sense, bubble sort is to swap the larger elements to the end of the list. It does this by iterating over the list multiple times, each time swapping adjacent elements that are in the wrong order.
